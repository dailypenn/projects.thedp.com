 Locust Walk, which just a week before was a bustling campus thoroughfare, was eerily empty. The Quad’s cast-iron gates, typically positioned wide open for thousands of students to pass through every day, were shuttered closed. And in Van Pelt Library, previously packed with students cramming for midterm exams, no one could be found.

 The University had just made the unprecedented decision to shift classes online and close on-campus housing for the remainder of the semester in an effort to limit the spread of COVID-19. The decision prompted cancellations of cherished Penn traditions such as Hey Day, commencement, and Penn Relays.

 In the 52 weeks that followed, the 40,000 members of the Penn community and people around the globe that had their worlds turned upside down by a pandemic that has taken nearly 2.7 million lives. 

 After initially planning to reopen campus in the fall, Penn reversed its plan and closed on-campus housing following a nationwide spike in cases just weeks before students were schedule to move in. In the spring, Penn was able to reopen on-campus housing to an overwhelmingly successful degree following a fall semester positivity rate of 1.55%. After a spike in early February to a positivity rate of 4.58% in the undergraduate community, Penn’s COVID-19 positivity rate has decreased for five straight weeks to a semester low of 0.19%. 

 Nearly one year after the campus first closed, Penn announced last week it was planning for a return to in-person, on-campus instruction in fall 2021, giving the Penn community a glimmer of hope that the end of the pandemic may be within sight. 

 To commemorate the 52 weeks since the University was first evacuated, The Daily Pennsylvanian spoke to 52 members of the Penn community, including students, faculty, staff, and West Philadelphia community members, who shared how the pandemic has impacted their lives. Ranging from University administrators detailing their decision to close campus to personal reflections on loss and grief, read their stories below:</p></div></div></div><div id="quotes1"><div color="#ffffff" class="shared__BackgroundWrapper-sc-1bmz6yb-0 bVprTE"><div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12"><div class="Quotes__QuoteWrapper-sc-1gz7dzf-0 iOHefF"><p color="#171717" class="Quotes__QuoteMark-sc-1gz7dzf-1 jrECOV"><strong>“</strong></p><p color="#171717" class="Quotes__QuoteText-sc-1gz7dzf-2 SSFly">The first momentous pandemic decision I had to make, back in early March 2020 — to evacuate Penn’s campus — was absolutely heart-wrenching, even though it was essential. Each day we didn’t delay saved lives. Yet emotionally, it was the toughest call of my presidency and probably my entire professional life. The response of the Penn community was not only heartening, it was often heroic, banding together with kindness and compassion to see our way through. 

 More recent momentous decisions — to welcome students back to campus in January and most recently to invite our graduating seniors to an on-campus commencement in May — have been among the most uplifting of my professional life, and strikingly for the very same reasons. Having welcomed students back to campus, I see students making conscious choices each day to keep each other and our entire Philadelphia community safe, while simultaneously giving back and supporting one another. This is making an on-campus commencement possible. To me, it’s perfect proof that there’s nothing like the friendship and bonds created here — there’s no place like Penn.</p><div class="Quotes__QuoteDivider-sc-1gz7dzf-4 eEKSSU"></div><p color="#171717" class="Quotes__QuotePerson-sc-1gz7dzf-3 bSdWsL">President Amy Gutmann</p></div></div></div></div><div><img src="https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dpn/8a461aa4-3d3b-443d-821c-09058b91fcdc.sized-1000x1000.png?" style="width:100%;box-shadow:0px 0px 7px 7px #00000029"/></div><div id="quotes2"><div color="#ffffff" class="shared__BackgroundWrapper-sc-1bmz6yb-0 bVprTE"><div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12"><div class="Quotes__QuoteWrapper-sc-1gz7dzf-0 iOHefF"><p color="#171717" class="Quotes__QuoteMark-sc-1gz7dzf-1 jrECOV"><strong>“</strong></p><p color="#171717" class="Quotes__QuoteText-sc-1gz7dzf-2 SSFly">I won’t soon forget the deep sadness of walking down a quiet Locust Walk with no students. Standing outside of an empty Franklin Field when it should have been the Penn Relays. Offering a prayer into a cell phone camera, instead of in front of robed graduates. Sitting in a quiet office with no work-study students. No food trucks, no tea with colleagues, no bumping into my work family near the LOVE statue while walking to a meeting. All of it very suddenly was gone. 

 I led quiet memorials that were either online or well-spaced for Penn colleagues and alumni whom we lost to COVID-19. Spent time on the phone listening to friends cry while asking for a prayer. Logged into countless meetings with staff and faculty and administrators — all of us doing our best while navigating our own emotions and challenges.</p><div class="Quotes__QuoteDivider-sc-1gz7dzf-4 eEKSSU"></div><p color="#171717" class="Quotes__QuotePerson-sc-1gz7dzf-3 bSdWsL">Vice President for Social Equity and Community Chaz Howard</p></div></div><div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12"><div class="Quotes__QuoteWrapper-sc-1gz7dzf-0 iOHefF"><p color="#171717" class="Quotes__QuoteMark-sc-1gz7dzf-1 jrECOV"><strong>“</strong></p><p color="#171717" class="Quotes__QuoteText-sc-1gz7dzf-2 SSFly">On this journey, through the grief, sadness, and loss, I was forced to have honest conversations with myself about the world I want to create in partnership with my loved ones, friends, colleagues, and students.

I can do almost all my work remotely. Nonetheless, this past year has been hard on me.  Probably the two biggest issues for me are related to family. I had a grandchild born in July and have not been able to hold her and probably won’t until she is a year old. I have three other grandchildren and have not been able to play with them. FaceTime and Zoom engagements just are no substitute for in-person play. I also have not been able to be with my 87-year-old mother.  

 And then there is the monotony that I find very hard.The same thing, same rooms, same screens over and over, day after day, month after month. I love to travel and learn about new places, and not being able to do that is also very psychologically hard on me. 

 The good thing is that I have been able to launch my new Benjamin Franklin course with great students. It would be better to be all together in a classroom and visit many of the Franklin sites in Philadelphia, like the Library Company and American Philosophical Society, but still it is great to have such engaged, eager students for a new course.</p><div class="Quotes__QuoteDivider-sc-1gz7dzf-4 eEKSSU"></div><p color="#171717" class="Quotes__QuotePerson-sc-1gz7dzf-3 bSdWsL">Vice Provost for Global Initiatives Ezekiel Emanuel</p></div></div><div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12"><div class="Quotes__QuoteWrapper-sc-1gz7dzf-0 iOHefF"><p color="#171717" class="Quotes__QuoteMark-sc-1gz7dzf-1 jrECOV"><strong>“</strong></p><p color="#171717" class="Quotes__QuoteText-sc-1gz7dzf-2 SSFly">I did not teach in the fall, so I was going on only the experience of the half-semester of Zoom from last spring. Trying to conduct a whole term of writing workshops through a little rectangle of a cathode-ray-tube-like device (that&#x27;s an image from my &#x27;50s TV childhood, when the screens were all about 7 square inches) seemed almost like a contradiction: How do you get them to be vulnerable with their emotions in such a setting? Well, I can report the following: They have fairly startled me with their earnestness and decency. Is it still hard as a teacher? Incredibly so. I find you can get only half as much done. I have no idea why, although perhaps it&#x27;s just me. To the extent we are holding it together, the kids get the major credit. Would I ever wish to do this again?

This has been especially true of our campus partners who have been leading the University’s Penn Cares efforts this year.

So, I’ve definitely been trying to use this time to voice my concerns and see how much positive change I can be a part of making.</p><div class="Quotes__QuoteDivider-sc-1gz7dzf-4 eEKSSU"></div><p color="#171717" class="Quotes__QuotePerson-sc-1gz7dzf-3 bSdWsL">Panhellenic Council President and College and Wharton junior Shriya Beesam</p></div></div><div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12"><div class="Quotes__QuoteWrapper-sc-1gz7dzf-0 iOHefF"><p color="#171717" class="Quotes__QuoteMark-sc-1gz7dzf-1 jrECOV"><strong>“</strong></p><p color="#171717" class="Quotes__QuoteText-sc-1gz7dzf-2 SSFly">The past year has forced me to reconsider everything I took for granted in the past.
