It's so crazy to believe that we are nearing the end of our time here at Penn. Time flies by so fast, and the pandemic definitely didn't help. It's been a pleasure serving as your President, and I am incredibly grateful to have had the opportunity to do so. Hopefully, with things beginning to return to normal, I want to use everything I've learned over the past three years to continue serving you as best as possible. I want to ensure that our last year at Penn is the most incredible one yet. Let's do this!","name":"Derek Nhieu","platform_points":["Feb Club - Feb Club, Feb Club, Feb Club. Feb Club is my #1 priority for our senior year. Planning for it begins as early as this spring and is where much of my time and effort will go. Think cooler events with a cheaper price tag: more fun for everyone. After these past three years, we deserve it.","More Merch - Class Board historically has not offered any merch during senior year. Let's change that. Remember all the merch you got the past few years? Why not complete the whole set? I want to continue offering cheaper and higher-quality merch to everyone. I'll make sure you're fitted up for the Gram - expect a lot of freebies, too.","Free Food - Who doesn't love free food? COVID interfered with the plan this year, but times are changing. I'm looking to offer as much free food as I possibly can this upcoming year. Errbody eats, and we all know food tastes better when it's on someone else's money. (P.S. I especially love food trucks.)","Outdoor Events - We've been in quarantine and on Zoom for long enough. It's time for us to (responsibly) go outside and touch some grass. I want to make a more significant push for outdoor events since we've been indoors too long. Say goodbye to isolation, and hello to social connection.","School Collaborations - One of my biggest dreams I've had since freshman year is to push boundaries and expand beyond the traditional scope of Class Board by hosting events with other colleges. As far as I know, this hasn't really ever happened yet. COVID complicated things, but now we are back on track. The more, the merrier!","Advocacy - I want to continue supporting the causes that our class cares about through Class Board. Whether through collaborations, partnerships, fundraising, or raising awareness, there are many important causes where we can dedicate our time, effort, and attention. I am very open to hearing and working with student groups and members of our class to make this happen."],"campaign_website":""}],"Executive_VP":[{"facebook_url":"","image":{"src":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/2a27ca4fd83f81a7728e12298205d9eb/6e63d/Joel_Olujide_DPPhoto.jpg","srcSet":"/static/2a27ca4fd83f81a7728e12298205d9eb/b315d/Joel_Olujide_DPPhoto.jpg 100w,\n/static/2a27ca4fd83f81a7728e12298205d9eb/8295c/Joel_Olujide_DPPhoto.jpg 200w,\n/static/2a27ca4fd83f81a7728e12298205d9eb/6e63d/Joel_Olujide_DPPhoto.jpg 400w,\n/static/2a27ca4fd83f81a7728e12298205d9eb/7b2a1/Joel_Olujide_DPPhoto.jpg 600w,\n/static/2a27ca4fd83f81a7728e12298205d9eb/d1f84/Joel_Olujide_DPPhoto.jpg 800w,\n/static/2a27ca4fd83f81a7728e12298205d9eb/c83f4/Joel_Olujide_DPPhoto.jpg 1024w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}},"instagram_handle":"joelolujide","introduction":"I've honestly had a blast working with the class board and having a part to play in the future of our class as well as upholding many of Penn's traditions, as well as creating new experiences that resonate with our unique college experience.

There's no doubt we've all been through a lot--especially these past two years--but I'm determined to make sure we get our last hurrah! I will work hard to make sure your voices are heard and help plan events that YOU want--events that will create memories that will stay with you for years to come.
