I was very involved in policy change in my high school, changing many of the rules in the handbook to address the concerns of the students as well as creating policy change throughout my hometown in addiction prevention. I went on to petition for policy change throughout the state of Massachusetts. I love voicing the concerns of others and putting change to action, which is why I think I would be a great fit for the UA.","name":"Anooshey Ikhlas","platform_points":["Better cultural spaces for the different cultural groups around campus.","Provide incoming students with more resources (mentorship program) that are more specific to their major and plans.","Better support the surrounding Philadelphia education system by strengthening the ABCS program and being a support for tutoring programs, especially in helping the transition out of covid (whenever possible)."],"campaign_website":""},{"facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/asaad.manzar.1","image":{"src":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/937c1882994120a9d6827bbf12089ea2/6e63d/Asaad_Manzar_DPPhoto.jpg","srcSet":"/static/937c1882994120a9d6827bbf12089ea2/b315d/Asaad_Manzar_DPPhoto.jpg 100w,\n/static/937c1882994120a9d6827bbf12089ea2/8295c/Asaad_Manzar_DPPhoto.jpg 200w,\n/static/937c1882994120a9d6827bbf12089ea2/6e63d/Asaad_Manzar_DPPhoto.jpg 400w,\n/static/937c1882994120a9d6827bbf12089ea2/7b2a1/Asaad_Manzar_DPPhoto.jpg 600w,\n/static/937c1882994120a9d6827bbf12089ea2/d1f84/Asaad_Manzar_DPPhoto.jpg 800w,\n/static/937c1882994120a9d6827bbf12089ea2/a36da/Asaad_Manzar_DPPhoto.jpg 1170w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}},"instagram_handle":"Asaad_Manzar","introduction":"Hi everyone!
