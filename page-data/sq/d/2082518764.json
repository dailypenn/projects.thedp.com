My name is Mackenzie Sleeman, and I am a New Yorker and sophomore transfer from Villanova. In my free time, I love to play tennis, swim with friends, hike with my little sister, and watch movies with my family! I want to join the Undergraduate Assembly because I recognize the power of transfer student voices, and believe in strengthening our ties to the broader Penn society.","name":"Mackenzie Sleeman","platform_points":["XCAT PRIME: Expedite the XCAT process so that students are better aware of degree expectations. Create transfer course equivalents that count towards electives to ensure that students graduate on time.","Transfer Learning Community: Create an inclusive learning environment in the form of a transfer-only writing seminar. The curriculum will acknowledge that transfers already have some experience with college-level writing.","Club Access Initiative:\n- Help juniors join organizations that are traditionally only open to freshmen or sophomores. \n- Create sessions that allow extracurricular groups and clubs to connect with incoming transfer students.","Transfer Advising: Appoint 2-3 pre-major advisors who will concentrate on helping transfer students acclimate to Penn. Advisors will have a clear understanding of program requirements to assist with transfer credit.","Build Community: Fund and promote class events (2024/2025) designed to help transfers find their communities beyond the Transfer Student Organization. Energize students to attend spirit, service, and sporting events."]}]}}]}}}
