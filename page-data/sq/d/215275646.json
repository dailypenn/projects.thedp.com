I am Ben. I am from New York City. As the largest and most diverse part of Penn, the College needs a stronger community. We need more aspects of Penn directed towards the betterment of our college life and overall success. Big renovations are needed to make us feel like an important part of the Penn community. I will be your voice for these changes. I hope to stand with you for any issue you feel holds the College back and tackle it in a pragmatic way.","name":"Ben Kassan","platform_points":["College GSRs","Greater use of dining dollars","NSO College bonding","College Mentors","Citi Bikes","CAS Merch"]}]}}]}}}
