I'm wrapping up my freshman year as a CIS major, and it's been tough balancing my extracurricular interests with my (unfortunate) affinity toward engineering. I also really struggle with anxiety, and I've experienced first-hand how overwhelming things can get here in the eQuad when you also want to engage with all the things that bring you joy. But–I don't think all hope is lost. Let's break the stereotype and find some balance together.
