Unlike the undergraduate assembly who are involved in making policy changes, a class president is supposed to be representative of and able to unite the student body. As someone who balances the M&T workload, a vibrant social life, an intensive fitness program, and my family, I doubt there are many individuals who I do not represent in at least one of these aspects. As a class president, I would be committed to preserving and improving our traditions and to uniting the student body.","name":"Gabriel Dyssell-Hofinger","platform_points":["Firstly, seasonal social activities such as freshman snowball fight with all classes cancelled for the first snow day of the year","Secondly, I want to bring a taste of South Africa and host monthly “Braais” (much better barbeques) in the quad which will be open to all freshman","Thirdly, bringing together social activities and mental health awareness by implementing monthly puppy therapy sessions","Fourthly, organizing subsidized beach days with accessible transportation and free food","Fifthly, day trip to New York city to expose UPenn students to all the Big Apple has to offer","Sixthly, a water day with water guns, balloons, ice cream and slip and slide"],"campaign_website":null},{"facebook_url":null,"image":{"src":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/3e440a1a57c7ff4ab02c947e90f5206d/6e63d/Martina%20Bulgarelli.jpg","srcSet":"/static/3e440a1a57c7ff4ab02c947e90f5206d/b315d/Martina%20Bulgarelli.jpg 100w,\n/static/3e440a1a57c7ff4ab02c947e90f5206d/8295c/Martina%20Bulgarelli.jpg 200w,\n/static/3e440a1a57c7ff4ab02c947e90f5206d/6e63d/Martina%20Bulgarelli.jpg 400w,\n/static/3e440a1a57c7ff4ab02c947e90f5206d/7b2a1/Martina%20Bulgarelli.jpg 600w,\n/static/3e440a1a57c7ff4ab02c947e90f5206d/d1f84/Martina%20Bulgarelli.jpg 800w,\n/static/3e440a1a57c7ff4ab02c947e90f5206d/c4521/Martina%20Bulgarelli.jpg 991w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}},"instagram_handle":null,"introduction":"I'm Martina Bulgarelli from Italy.
