I was able to hone my on-the-ground reporting and writing skills, with which I had almost no experience until this summer. At the same time, I continued to refine my photojournalism capabilities and tell the stories most important to the Penn and Philadelphia communities, including the Black Lives Matter protests and the multi-faceted impact of the pandemic. Without the support of my alumni mentors and the alumni who helped to fund the program, I have no doubt that I would not be as well positioned as I am today to become a professional journalist.","position":"Senior Photographer","image":{"src":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/7170ac178fe8b16a8c2cde973d2a3ca8/5926f/chase.jpg","srcSet":"/static/7170ac178fe8b16a8c2cde973d2a3ca8/034c8/chase.jpg 250w,\n/static/7170ac178fe8b16a8c2cde973d2a3ca8/bae4e/chase.jpg 500w,\n/static/7170ac178fe8b16a8c2cde973d2a3ca8/5926f/chase.jpg 1000w,\n/static/7170ac178fe8b16a8c2cde973d2a3ca8/9d169/chase.jpg 1500w,\n/static/7170ac178fe8b16a8c2cde973d2a3ca8/cd50d/chase.jpg 2000w,\n/static/7170ac178fe8b16a8c2cde973d2a3ca8/1a70b/chase.jpg 2903w","sizes":"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"}}}}}]}}]},"others":{"edges":[{"node":{"childrenStreetUtbGt2020Json":[{"title":"From 'The Simpsons' to Campus Activism, Street Is Here, There, and Everywhere","description":"Yes, you might remember 34th Street as the DP’s cooler and sexier older sister.
