"," Getting into Wharton clubs can be tough! But it should not be. Everyone at Wharton is equally deserving and club recruiting can really put one’s self-esteem down. Using my platform I would make sure clubs are being inclusive and thoughtful of their recruiting process. ","College can be difficult, but reaching out for help can be even harder. I would like to make mental health resources readily available so asking for help is effortless. This way students are more comfortable with taking the next step to improving their state of mind and consequently their academics!","I would work to promote financial literacy and wellness among undergraduate students and advocate for policies and initiatives that support affordable education, student loan forgiveness, and financial aid.","I would like to focus on promoting leadership development opportunities for undergraduate students, such as organizing workshops, mentorship programs, or networking events.

My name is Mackenzie Sleeman, I am a New Yorker, and a sophomore transfer student from Villanova University studying PPE. I am rerunning for the Undergraduate Assembly because my tangible efforts as New Transfer Representative have enabled me to experience the passion that emerges while serving an underrepresented community. As a College Representative, I hope to continue to employ my fresh, unique perspective to challenge the traditional Penn academic environment. In my free time, I love to go on walks with my little sister, watch Formula One, and play tennis with friends.
