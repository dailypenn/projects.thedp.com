Thank you for showing up to Merch Madness in record breaking numbers. Thank you for turning this class into a family through Sophomore Spotlights and Blind Brunches. Thank you for being the most spirited class and rocking 900+ quarter zips around campus. But more than anything, thank you for your hellos on Locust, smiles at events, and feedback in emails. Nothing makes me happier than giving back to a class that has given me so much: family, endless laughter, deep conversations, and memories to last a lifetime. I can’t wait for what’s to come.
