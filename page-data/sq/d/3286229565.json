Each day we didn’t delay saved lives. Yet emotionally, it was the toughest call of my presidency and probably my entire professional life. The response of the Penn community was not only heartening, it was often heroic, banding together with kindness and compassion to see our way through. \n\n More recent momentous decisions — to welcome students back to campus in January and most recently to invite our graduating seniors to an on-campus commencement in May — have been among the most uplifting of my professional life, and strikingly for the very same reasons. Having welcomed students back to campus, I see students making conscious choices each day to keep each other and our entire Philadelphia community safe, while simultaneously giving back and supporting one another. This is making an on-campus commencement possible. To me, it’s perfect proof that there’s nothing like the friendship and bonds created here — there’s no place like Penn.","person":"President Amy Gutmann"}]},{"section":"section2","items":[{"text":"I won’t soon forget the deep sadness of walking down a quiet Locust Walk with no students. Standing outside of an empty Franklin Field when it should have been the Penn Relays. Offering a prayer into a cell phone camera, instead of in front of robed graduates. Sitting in a quiet office with no work-study students. No food trucks, no tea with colleagues, no bumping into my work family near the LOVE statue while walking to a meeting. All of it very suddenly was gone. \n\n I led quiet memorials that were either online or well-spaced for Penn colleagues and alumni whom we lost to COVID-19. Spent time on the phone listening to friends cry while asking for a prayer. Logged into countless meetings with staff and faculty and administrators — all of us doing our best while navigating our own emotions and challenges.","person":"Vice President for Social Equity and Community Chaz Howard"},{"text":"On this journey, through the grief, sadness, and loss, I was forced to have honest conversations with myself about the world I want to create in partnership with my loved ones, friends, colleagues, and students.

I can do almost all my work remotely. Nonetheless, this past year has been hard on me.  Probably the two biggest issues for me are related to family. I had a grandchild born in July and have not been able to hold her and probably won’t until she is a year old. I have three other grandchildren and have not been able to play with them. FaceTime and Zoom engagements just are no substitute for in-person play. I also have not been able to be with my 87-year-old mother.  \n\n And then there is the monotony that I find very hard.The same thing, same rooms, same screens over and over, day after day, month after month. I love to travel and learn about new places, and not being able to do that is also very psychologically hard on me. \n\n The good thing is that I have been able to launch my new Benjamin Franklin course with great students. It would be better to be all together in a classroom and visit many of the Franklin sites in Philadelphia, like the Library Company and American Philosophical Society, but still it is great to have such engaged, eager students for a new course.","person":"Vice Provost for Global Initiatives Ezekiel Emanuel"}]},{"section":"section3","items":[{"text":"The COVID-19 paradox continues to reverberate to this day: While we were forced to slow down and, at times, stand still, many have also been forced to absorb more work, spanning more hours, with fewer opportunities to rest.

I remain in awe of the steadfast determination my colleagues have shown this year. Similarly, our students have shown tremendous strength and resilience, inspiring all of us with their creativity and grit.","person":"Chief Wellness Officer Benoit Dubé"},{"text":"Professionally, I take much pride in the heroic and incredible Student Health Service team who changed internal operations in such a way that allowed us to provide uninterrupted patient care to our students, while keeping our own staff and our campus safe!

From three hours on 95, inching through traffic with NPR, to a short sprint to my dining room chair and an intimate relationship with my computer screen. A surprising and successful ability to run a center and deliver services to students in the remote domain.  Deeply mourning hugging my family and friends in person and relishing the unexpected joy of virtual gatherings where laughter is shared. Loving the little white dog who follows me everywhere, the plethora of The New York Times recipes now bubbling on the stove, the athletic wear that suffices for work clothes, the opportunity to do a load of laundry in between Zoom meetings, the exercise videos I can follow in my room, the hope of a return to a 'new normal,' now that I am vaccinated and enjoy wearing a mask!","person":"CAPS Senior Clinical Director Michal Saraf"},{"text":"Having limited time with my loved ones, especially my nieces and nephews, and hearing about the loss of life was hard. It reminded me of the pain of past losses. It still does. Cultivating hope and joy was a struggle at the beginning, but providing therapy, keeping in touch with our amazing CAPS staff, Zooming with loved ones, and meeting with students (like with CAPSAB) were connections that felt healing for me. We were trying to figure out this pandemic together. We still are. There is a shared humanity that continues to move me forward.

I am inspired and proud of the courage, compassion, and innovation of all health care workers on the front lines — but especially nurses. Whether providing care in intensive care units; helping patients and families transition from life to death, to community testing and vaccination; to providing trusted information to allay fears, nurses have stepped up to combat the pandemic – at a great personal cost.

A cappella is, by nature, a group effort, so not being able to thrive on each other’s energy when navigating virtual rehearsals and attempting to create a close-knit family while miles and miles apart has been disheartening.

Although I was still able to remain an EMT on MERT, the pandemic halted my travels to Guatemala to engage in a anti-violence project. However, this merely opened the door to return to West Philadelphia and volunteer at Sayre, a Federally Qualified Health Center in West Philadelphia, assisting with the mobile care program and COVID-19 testing site.

But I’ve been doing the best I can, as I’m sure everyone has been, to remain an active member of the communities I’m a part of and to keep our groups as strong and engaged as they can be right now. As the president of Panhellenic Council, I’ve been trying to use this time as a chance to realign our vision and to think critically about the prejudices and barriers to entry that Greek life may provide. I think that one good thing (maybe the only good thing, but still) that came out of this pandemic was all the free time it provided for us to stop and critically think about how our organizations operate, and how we want the future to look like.
