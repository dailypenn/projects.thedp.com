For this year, I have many great ideas for events that the class board can hold. From networking events to group parties, I will ensure that these events are a good time and have something for everyone. I will ensure that the class of 2025 (goated) will start a new tradition that will cement our legacy.","name":"Shivam Shah","platform_points":[],"facebook_url":null,"instagram_handle":null,"campaign_website":null}],"Engineering_Chair":[{"image":{"src":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/ab3887e2d3f0e6f5c36d3eb9dd995dec/6e63d/Fiona-Wu.jpg","srcSet":"/static/ab3887e2d3f0e6f5c36d3eb9dd995dec/b315d/Fiona-Wu.jpg 100w,\n/static/ab3887e2d3f0e6f5c36d3eb9dd995dec/8295c/Fiona-Wu.jpg 200w,\n/static/ab3887e2d3f0e6f5c36d3eb9dd995dec/6e63d/Fiona-Wu.jpg 400w,\n/static/ab3887e2d3f0e6f5c36d3eb9dd995dec/7b2a1/Fiona-Wu.jpg 600w,\n/static/ab3887e2d3f0e6f5c36d3eb9dd995dec/d1f84/Fiona-Wu.jpg 800w,\n/static/ab3887e2d3f0e6f5c36d3eb9dd995dec/379af/Fiona-Wu.jpg 2180w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}},"introduction":"My name's Fiona Wu and I'm re-running for Engineering Class Chair.

This ranges from proper accomodation at events (i.e. allergen and dietary information) to making sure that the graphics we post are easily accessible and readable.
