For this year, I have many great ideas for events that the class board can hold. From networking events to group parties, I will ensure that these events are a good time and have something for everyone. I will ensure that the class of 2025 (goated) will start a new tradition that will cement our legacy.","name":"Shivam Shah","platform_points":[]}],"Engineering_Chair":[{"image":{"src":{"childImageSharp":{"fluid":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAUABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAGQABAAIDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQFAQID/8QAFgEBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQID/9oADAMBAAIQAxAAAAGxjSKmWzZJ2hmd6Cn/xAAdEAACAgEFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAgEDEBESIjEy/9oACAEBAAEFAiLlZxvL2cO8bYg1P//EABYRAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEQAv/aAAgBAwEBPwEJif/EABYRAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABACMf/aAAgBAgEBPwEvT//EAB4QAAEEAQUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAAhAREiExQVFx/9oACAEBAAY/AljRF7XzB8TXt7nQR//EABsQAAICAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEVEhMUGR/9oACAEBAAE/IRQshMBoX3CuzBKyYJ2PRDwLomuD/9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABAsN0D/xAAZEQEAAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABABARITH/2gAIAQMBAT8QyC1xE3P/xAAZEQEAAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABABARITH/2gAIAQIBAT8QXDT0hyf/xAAdEAEAAwEAAgMAAAAAAAAAAAABABEhMUFRcaHR/9oACAEBAAE/EKAVwNWFFAuh+Cay4uWH1FlXVHQnSvz3AA8Fw7ijXCgDi+ZVUVton//Z","aspectRatio":1,"src":"/static/ab3887e2d3f0e6f5c36d3eb9dd995dec/6e63d/Fiona-Wu.jpg","srcSet":"/static/ab3887e2d3f0e6f5c36d3eb9dd995dec/b315d/Fiona-Wu.jpg 100w,\n/static/ab3887e2d3f0e6f5c36d3eb9dd995dec/8295c/Fiona-Wu.jpg 200w,\n/static/ab3887e2d3f0e6f5c36d3eb9dd995dec/6e63d/Fiona-Wu.jpg 400w,\n/static/ab3887e2d3f0e6f5c36d3eb9dd995dec/7b2a1/Fiona-Wu.jpg 600w,\n/static/ab3887e2d3f0e6f5c36d3eb9dd995dec/d1f84/Fiona-Wu.jpg 800w,\n/static/ab3887e2d3f0e6f5c36d3eb9dd995dec/379af/Fiona-Wu.jpg 2180w","sizes":"(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px"}}}},"introduction":"My name's Fiona Wu and I'm re-running for Engineering Class Chair.

This ranges from proper accomodation at events (i.e. allergen and dietary information) to making sure that the graphics we post are easily accessible and readable. It also means creating a broad range of events so that everyone has a Class Board event that they like.
