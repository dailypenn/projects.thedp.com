My name is Andrew and I am proud to be running to be your transfer representative. I’m a sophomore transfer from Northwestern, originally from Vancouver, Canada. I think we can all agree that being a transfer student is an overwhelming, daunting, and exhilarating shift in our lives. What I want to do is to give the transfer community a voice at Penn and fight for changes that you want to see. I believe in making this campus a better place for us and future transfers, and I’m super excited to help serve our community.

Open up seats to Junior transfers in clubs typically for freshman/sophomores. ","Priority Tutoring: Give transfers priority access to tutoring services as many are coming from schools where pre-reqs covered different things, content was covered at different paces, etc.  ","XCAT 2.0: Expedite XCAT requests so transfers have clarity when registering for courses. Appoint advisors to ensure requests are being accessed and decisions maximize the amount of credit transferred. ","UA Diversity Engagement: Bolster under-represented voices at Penn by holding meetings/events with advocacy groups and the UA. This will foster conversations allowing the UA to better understand their needs.","Reserved Class Seats: Registering later for classes causes many transfers to not have space in classes they wish to take.
