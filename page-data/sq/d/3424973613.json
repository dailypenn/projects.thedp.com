During this unprecedented time, I will continue finding ways for our class to stay connected in this virtual setting. I will also make sure plans are in place to have a hopefully incredible spring semester with Feb Club, Hey Day, and more.

My name is Jay Mudholkar, and I’m running for re-election for Wharton Chair on Class Board. Literally can’t believe it’s been three years since I first joined, but the experience has been incredible: from Econ Scream freshman year, to U-Night sophomore year, to P-Sweaters junior year, I’ve loved every minute of it and deciding to run was one of my best decisions at Penn. My goal for senior year on Class Board is to make the absolute most out of our modified senior year events, and help plan an unreal spring.","instagram_handle":null,"name":"Jay Mudholkar","platform_points":["Plan an incredible Feb Club: the thing I was most excited for throughout being on Class Board has been Feb Club senior spring, and it's my top priority this year","Make sure Hey Day is back and better than ever: it's disappointing that we never had Hey Day junior year, but it's a priority to have a similar experience in-person this spring","Be a voice for seniors that are away from campus: I'm currently the only member on CB that's living outside of Philadelphia for the semester permanently"],"youtube_video_url":null}]}}]}}}
