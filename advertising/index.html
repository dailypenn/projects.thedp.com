                    <h1>The Best Way to Reach Penn</h1>
                    <p>
                        We are The Daily Pennsylvanian, the newspaper by and for the students of the University of Pennsylvania. When our readers open “the DP” every morning, they open a world of campus and city news, feature stories, sports, commentary, advertising, and much more. Whether in our daily newspaper, our weekly magazine, our special issues, or our websites, The Daily Pennsylvanian is the first read for the Penn community.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In an era when we often hear about the struggles of mass-market commercial newspapers and about students only getting their information online, The Daily Pennsylvanian thrives as a community newspaper because we remain relevant to our audience of devoted
                        readers. And for our advertisers, that’s why we are a proven and eff ective way — and still the best way — to reach Penn. We off er multiple media in print, online and out-of-home that reach diff erent segments of the Penn
                        market, from students to faculty and staff to parents and alumni, allowing you to choose the medium or media mix that best suits your advertising needs.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Ad Submission</h3>
                    <p>
                        All advertising is subject to acceptance by The Daily Pennsylvanian, which reserves the right to reject any advertisement at its sole discretion at any time prior to publication. The Daily Pennsylvanian will not knowingly publish advertisements which unlawfully discriminate on the basis of race, color, age, sex, sexual orientation, religion, national origin, ancestry, or physical handicap.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Daily Pennsylvanian will make all reasonable effort to see that advertising is published, displayed or distributed as ordered and accepted. However, The Daily Pennsylvanian will not be responsible for any consequential damages resulting from failure to do so.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Advertisers and agencies forwarding insertion orders which contain incorrect rates or conditions are advised that the advertising called for will be inserted and charged in accordance with the rates and regulations stated in this Rate Book and The Daily Pennsylvanian Basic Advertising Contract.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The advertiser and/or agency agrees to assume full and complete responsibility and liability for the content (including text representations, illustrations, and copyrights) of any advertisements placed in The Daily Pennsylvanian and/or its related print and online publications and/or its other advertising products and services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Advertising cancelled after the deadline for publication will be removed from the issue, but the advertiser remains liable for payment of the full cost of the ad.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Annual Contracts</h3>
                    <p>
                        Annual Contract advertising agreements commit an advertiser to run a specified dollar amount of advertising during a 12-month period in return for discounted advertising rates. Advertisers who do not fulfill their Annual Contract agree to pay, at termination, a short rate (adjustment) for all advertising discounted under the contract.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Advertisers may upgrade to a larger contract, at a lower rate, at any time during the contract. The new rate will be effective for all advertising run after the date of the upgrade, but the new rate is not retroactive to advertising previously run.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Annual Contract rates in this Rate Book are not guaranteed beyond August 15, 2016. An advertiser whose Annual Contract expires after August 15, 2016 will pay the published 2016-17 rate for the same contract level.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Annual Contracts and contract upgrades must be approved by The Daily Pennsylvanian’s Director of Sales & Marketing before becoming effective.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Errors &amp; Adjustments</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Daily Pennsylvanian will be responsible for errors in advertisements only in proportion to the bearing that the error has in relation to the entire ad, as determined by the Finance Manager of The Daily Pennsylvanian.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Daily Pennsylvanian will not consider adjustment of payment for any advertisement involving typographical errors or erroneous insertion unless notice is given to the Finance Manager within ten (10) days of the first monthly statement. The Daily Pennsylvanian will not be liable for more than one incorrect insertion of any advertisement.

                    </p>

                    <b>Paper Sizes:</b> The Daily Pennsylvanian prints its publications in two sizes. A full-size broadsheet newspaper is 12” wide by 21” tall with a maximum printed area per page of 10.875” wide by 20” tall. A tabloid pull-out is 10.5” wide by 12” tall with a maximum printed area per page of 9.046” wide by 10.5” tall.                
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Ad Sizes:</b> Sizes are expressed as the number of columns wide by the number of inches tall (i.e. a “2 x 4” ad is 2 columns wide by 4 inches tall). Multiplying columns by inches gives the total number of column inches (i.e. 2 x 4 = 8 column inches). Multiplying column inches by the ad rate gives the ad cost.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Any ad size can be created according to these rules:

                        <li>Widths are in full columns (no half-columns or fractions)</li>
                        <li>Heights are in half-inch increments; minimum height 1” tall</li>
                        <li>Minimum size: 2 col. inches (1 col. x 2” or 2 col. x 1”)</li>
                        <li>Broadsheet ads taller than 17” will be charged and run as a full page ad (20” tall). Tabloid ads taller than 8.5” will be charged and run as a full page ad (10.5” tall).</li>

                <p>
                    It is <i>not</i> necessary to “reserve space” prior to submitting an ad; both the ad order and ad copy are due by deadline.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Should ad copy not be received by deadline, the ad will be subject to cancellation from the edition. Advertising cancelled after deadline is subject to full charge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Advertisers requiring proofs, please add one business day to the deadlines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Occasionally, displays ads can be accepted after deadline. If a late ad order is accepted, there will be a late charge of 10% of the ad’s total cost.
