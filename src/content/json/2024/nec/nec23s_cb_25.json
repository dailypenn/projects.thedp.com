I\u2019ve enjoyed being that person pouring you hot chocolate, running around campus with 1,000 donuts in residential carts, and handing out quarter-zips. I pride myself on being a doer. As Class President, I will build on this momentum by hosting more and better events. I want to throw bangers at Smoke's, plan fun events like Sports Tournaments and Pop-ups, and drop more fire merch.
