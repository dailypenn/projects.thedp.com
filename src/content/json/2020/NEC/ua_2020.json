      "introduction": "Hey Penn! My name is Alfredo Wolfermann and I am a second year student from Miami, Florida. I was born in Caracas, Venezuela and came to the United States when I was 10 years old. Getting integrated with a new culture and language was challenging at first, but I had many people who helped me along the way. Being one of these people for others in challenging situations was my main focus while I served on the Undergraduate Assembly's 47th Session last year. I hope that I can continue to work on initiatives that allow the student body, especially freshmen, to more easily make new friends and find groups this school year!"
