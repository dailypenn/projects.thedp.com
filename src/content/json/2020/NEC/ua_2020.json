I hope to continue the work I\u2019ve been doing to fight for change on campus, specifically through financial, academic, and equity-based means. I also want to continue to break down barriers between Penn students and create more sustainable dialogue with Penn administration to ensure our concerns are being acknowledged and addressed. Finally, I aspire to continue making significant and lasting contributions to the larger Penn community to shape the future of the University. I\u2019d love your support to accomplish these goals!",

Penn can challenge us not only academically, but emotionally and physically. I even wrote an article about it...!  However, during my second year, I strongly missed the opportunity to impact the Penn community at large. That being said, I have excitedly decided to seek out the chance to run for PSG.

I\u2019m sure none of us expected our very short time at Penn to take place in the midst of a global pandemic, social unrest, and disunity. I wish to be a representative of the College of Arts and Sciences because I firmly believe that as students in the world today, we have a responsibility to be role models and agents of change like never before. With the CAS encompassing students of a wide variety of study and thought, it is up to us to be inclusive and understand ideas from various perspectives. Although our first year at Penn did not go as we planned, it does not mean that we cannot adapt and overcome the challenges we may face in the future, and I would appreciate the opportunity to represent the student body of the CAS as we do.

Being one of these people for others in challenging situations was my main focus while I served on the Undergraduate Assembly's 47th Session last year.
