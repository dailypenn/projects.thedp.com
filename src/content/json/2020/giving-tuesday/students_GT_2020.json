    "description": "Within my time as a DP summer intern, I gained several different editorial and management skills, and was also given the opportunity to develop close working relationships with fellow interns and my mentor from The Philadelphia Inquirer. The program gave interns and the overall summer season at the DP a sense of greater impetus and purpose. We are all very lucky to have received alumni support to further not only our personal growth as journalists, but to contribute greatly to the overall success of the company.",

    "description": "Participating in the DP summer internship program allowed me to do some of the most meaningful journalism of my career. I was able to hone my on-the-ground reporting and writing skills, with which I had almost no experience until this summer. At the same time, I continued to refine my photojournalism capabilities and tell the stories most important to the Penn and Philadelphia communities, including the Black Lives Matter protests and the multi-faceted impact of the pandemic. Without the support of my alumni mentors and the alumni who helped to fund the program, I have no doubt that I would not be as well positioned as I am today to become a professional journalist.",
