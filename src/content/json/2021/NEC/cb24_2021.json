We, as Penn students, need to reprioritize what is most important, beginning with our own wellbeing and then needs of our community: throughout the past few years, I’ve dedicated myself to putting mental health first and devising awareness projects for students to do so. I’ve been a leader on First Year Committee in creating projects like the Econ Scream and We’re Not Really Strangers, and—as a FGLI student—I understand how we must make others heard in Philly.
