      "introduction": "Hello there! It's so crazy to believe that we are nearing the end of our time here at Penn. Time flies by so fast, and the pandemic definitely didn't help. It's been a pleasure serving as your President, and I am incredibly grateful to have had the opportunity to do so. Hopefully, with things beginning to return to normal, I want to use everything I've learned over the past three years to continue serving you as best as possible. I want to ensure that our last year at Penn is the most incredible one yet. Let's do this!",

        "Feb Club - Feb Club, Feb Club, Feb Club. Feb Club is my #1 priority for our senior year. Planning for it begins as early as this spring and is where much of my time and effort will go. Think cooler events with a cheaper price tag: more fun for everyone. After these past three years, we deserve it.",
        "More Merch - Class Board historically has not offered any merch during senior year. Let's change that. Remember all the merch you got the past few years? Why not complete the whole set? I want to continue offering cheaper and higher-quality merch to everyone. I'll make sure you're fitted up for the Gram - expect a lot of freebies, too.",
        "Free Food - Who doesn't love free food? COVID interfered with the plan this year, but times are changing. I'm looking to offer as much free food as I possibly can this upcoming year. Errbody eats, and we all know food tastes better when it's on someone else's money. (P.S. I especially love food trucks.)",
        "Outdoor Events - We've been in quarantine and on Zoom for long enough. It's time for us to (responsibly) go outside and touch some grass. I want to make a more significant push for outdoor events since we've been indoors too long. Say goodbye to isolation, and hello to social connection.",
        "School Collaborations - One of my biggest dreams I've had since freshman year is to push boundaries and expand beyond the traditional scope of Class Board by hosting events with other colleges. As far as I know, this hasn't really ever happened yet. COVID complicated things, but now we are back on track. The more, the merrier!",
        "Advocacy - I want to continue supporting the causes that our class cares about through Class Board. Whether through collaborations, partnerships, fundraising, or raising awareness, there are many important causes where we can dedicate our time, effort, and attention. I am very open to hearing and working with student groups and members of our class to make this happen."

From Zoom University, to having our FIRST in person Spring Fling, we've come a long way! Now that we're entering our senior year, I want to be able to wrap up and finish everything that we started ever since I joined Class Board as a sophomore as your Executive Vice President.",

It baffles me that we're going to be SENIORS soon, and to see how far we've come is truly remarkable. There's no doubt we've all been through a lot--especially these past two years--but I'm determined to make sure we get our last hurrah! I will work hard to make sure your voices are heard and help plan events that YOU want--events that will create memories that will stay with you for years to come. Here's to an unforgettable senior year of more food, more pop-ups, more merch, and most importantly, a PHENOMENAL Feb Club. As always, thank you so much for your continuous support, and I hope you give me the opportunity to continue fostering connection and community within our class! :)",

Gains szn never left- for the past 3 years, I have successfully negotiated budget increases, so we can give out more free merch, more free food, and create more good vibes.

She is VP of MNO, Program Director for Penn Model Congress, President of Penn Ghana, and a Black Student League board member. She loves teaching and mentoring younger students and is a part of philanthropy in West Philadelphia through the Netter Center.
