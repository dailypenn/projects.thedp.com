      "introduction": "Each transfer student\u2019s journey to Penn comprises a unique story filled with apprehension, excitement, and ambition; my goal is to share these stories with the Penn community. My name is Mackenzie Sleeman, and I am a New Yorker and sophomore transfer from Villanova. In my free time, I love to play tennis, swim with friends, hike with my little sister, and watch movies with my family! I want to join the Undergraduate Assembly because I recognize the power of transfer student voices, and believe in strengthening our ties to the broader Penn society.",
