    "The DP is more than an award winning editorial entity and media business proving ground, it is also a leading educational non-profit organization that for close to 140 years has been providing transformative experiences and financial support for Penn students. The Institutional Advancement  team works closely with professional staff and alumni on organizational storytelling, fundraising campaign design, volunteer engagement, donor stewardship, media content generation and management, and more.",
    "The IA team will help to tell the story of the DP, past, present and future, in order to generate the needed financial support and volunteer opportunities that will propel the DP forward. Working with our IA team is an exciting opportunity for students who are interested in nonprofit management, social entrepreneurship and organizational leadership. The work of the IA team directly impacts the lives of fellow students on staff. All dollars raised go directly to fellow Penn students at the DP, through: financial aid, salary stipends, internships, fellowships and more."
